SARIT
=====

[SARIT][sarit] texts have already been published as versioned TEI documents
through the [SARIT-corpus][sarit-repo] repository. For that reason, this folder
doesn't contain any texts. Doing so would just dupliacte clean data that we can
already find elsewhere, and it would duplicate a workstream that SARIT already
maintains.


Data format
-----------

SARIT texts are available as TEI XML files. All of these files are listed in
the root folder of the [SARIT-corpus][sarit-repo] repository ([example][ex]).


License

SARIT texts are generally available under a permissive license. [From the SARIT
